Adding a new line.... o

This is the main file for the repo.

This repository will be used for learning git.

In addition to learning git, people can learn how to make good commit messages.

A good commit message is like a good email. It has a well written easy to read
subject that is short, followed by a longer well written body. Both are
separated by a blank line. The subject should not be longer than 50 characters

For example:

xxxxxxxx1xxxxxxxxx2xxxxxxxxx3xxxxxxxxxx4xxxxxxxx5
This is the subject of my commit. No more than 50

This is the body of my commit, it can be longer than the subject
and should clearly explain what the purpose of this commit is.
